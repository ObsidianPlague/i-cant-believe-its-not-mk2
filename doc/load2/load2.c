*
*	LOAD2	- 	This program will perform either or both of the
*				following tasks on DMA 2 SYSTEMS ONLY!
*
*		1)	Load selected images, or images and tables from
*			selected image libraries (WIMP/BLIMP format)
*			into target system Image Rom area
*
*		2) Generate image tables for each of the selected images to
*			be included with the game source code.
*
*		The format of the generated tables can be supplied in the .lod
*		file as by a single line in the following format...
*
*	   IHDR keyword1:sz,keyword2:sz,...	 (no spaces except one after IHDR)
*
*		where IHDR begins in column 1
*			   keyword is one of the following:
*					SIZX,SIZY,ANIX,ANIY,SAG,CTRL,PAL,PWRD1,PWRD2,PWRD3,PTnx (n=0-9,x=X or Y)
*			   sz is a single character... B,W or L representing 
*					byte, word or long
*
*		If no IHDR line is supplied in the .lod file, the table is
*		written as follows:
*				SIZX:W,SIZY,W,SAG:L,ANIX:W,ANIY:W,CTRL:W,PAL:L

*
*	INVOCATION - load2 FILE FLAG1
*
*		FILE is an ASCII file which specifies the images to be loaded.
*		It is assumed to be in the SRCDIR directory (presumably where you
*		keep your source code). An extension of .lod is automatically
*		tacked on to the supplied filename.
*
*		For FLAG1 definitions, see routine instruct();
*
*	FORMAT OF .lod FILE....
*
*		* No Blank Lines
*		* First line contains fully qualified name of .img file starting in
*			column 1. If the filename is simple, then the filename is prefixed
*			with the enviornmental variable IMGDIR.
*		* Following lines contain (starting in column 1)...
*		  "---> img1:stcol,img2:stcol,img3:stcol,...,imglast:stcol"
*         * The ":stcol" part is optional and represents a number which is
*		  added to all non-zero pixels to allow for a palette placed
*           higher up in color ram. If omitted, it is taken to be 0.
*		* The "---> " pattern must be exact. All image names are separated
*		  by commas (no spaces).
*		* There can be as many images on a line as will fit in 255 columns.
*		* After last line of image names, you can start again with another
*			.img file.
*		* There is no limit to how many .img files you can take images from.
*		* WIMP will generate a .lod file for you. If you are using more
*			than 1 .img file, you will need to concatenate the files
*			created by WIMP.
*		* "***> staddr[,endaddr]" causes the counter to skip to staddr and
*					optionally checks that loading does not go past endaddr.
*		* "BBB> " followed by the name of a background file causes the
*			background to be handled as well
*		* "UNI> " followed by the name of a universe file causes the
*			universe to be handled as well
*		* "IHDR " indicates that a table definition style for images follows.
*		* "GLO> <filename>" global decls to <filename>
*		* "ASM> <filename>" assembleable image headers to <filename>
*            		  		  by default, headers go to imgtbl.asm
*		* "FRM> <filename>" .bin file containing compressed still pic or frames
*		* "PPP> #" pack pixel data with # bits per pixel, 0 <= # <= 8
*				  If 0, auto-pack to smallest number of bits.
*		* "ROM> staddr,endaddr"  Set address range to NOT load into memory
*		* "CON>"/"COF>" turns on and off checksums.
*		* "ZON>"/"ZOF>" turns on and off lead/trail zero compression.
*		* "MON>"/"MOF>" turns on and off multipart box mode
*		* "BON>"/"BOF>" turns on and off collision box mode
*
*		Any line starting with ';' or '*' or '/' will be ignored as a comment
